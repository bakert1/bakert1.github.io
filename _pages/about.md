Hi! Iâ€™m Tim, a computer scientist at the intersection of machine learning, software engineering, and medicine. I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at Eikon Therapeutics.


## Education

I earned dual Bachelor of Science degrees in Physics and Computer Science from Rowan University in 2017, receiving the "Excellence in Physics Medallion" for my contributions to the Physics and Astronomy department. My academic journey continued at the University of Michigan, where I completed a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering in 2023 under Professor John P. Hayes. Our research focused on energy-efficient machine learning for on-device applications.

During my Ph.D., I developed an interest in biomedical applications of machine learning, which led me to a one-year postdoctoral fellowship in radiology at the University of Michigan Hospital. I worked with Professor Nicholas Burris, M.D., applying advanced computer vision algorithms to cardiovascular disease treatment. This experience further deepend my appreciation for technology's role in medicine and broadened my research perspective on the promise and challenges of AI in healthcare.

## Research
My research spans the domains of efficient machine learning (ML) hardware and medical applications of artificial intelligence (AI).

During my Ph.D., I focused on deploying ML algorithms on resource-constrained devices like smartphones and medical devices. I studied ML accelerators, specialized hardware designed to execute computationally intensive ML workloads efficiently. My work centered on stochastic computing, a brain-inspired approach to implementing neural networks. Key contributions include:

1. Developing a comprehensive error analysis framework for stochastic computing
2. Designing more efficient weighted summation circuits, critical for most neural networks

In my postdoctoral research, I applied AI advances to medicine, specifically developing computer vision pipelines for analyzing chest CT and MRI scans. These automated ML pipelines assist physicians by providing faster, more detailed, and more consistent information than traditional manual analysis of medical images.

Currently, at Eikon Therapeutics, I'm developing ML pipelines to analyze vast datasets of cellular images captured by super-resolution fluorescent microscopes. This work supports high-throughput screening of compounds for novel therapeutics in oncology, immunology, and neuroscience. By leveraging advanced AI techniques, we're accelerating the drug discovery process and potentially opening new avenues for treatment.

Throughout my career, I've bridged the gap between theoretical AI advancements and their real-world applications, from optimizing ML hardware to developing AI-driven tools for medical imaging and drug discovery. Going forward, my goal is to further advance AI in healthcare by translating cutting-edge algorithms into practical, impactful solutions.

## Running
Running wasn't always a part of my life. In fact, I never imagined I'd spend significant time jogging about. But in 2018, a series of unexpected events led me to discover a passion for running.

The pivotal moment came one night when I impulsively agreed to run the 2019 Detroit marathon with a friend. A few drinks may have led to our initial decision, but we stuck to our commitment, signing up the next morning. Seven months later, we completed our first marathon.

During those months of training, I discovered a love for running I never knew I had. As my cardio improved, running transformed into a fulfilling and enjoyable activity. Most runs are low-intensity, offering time to reflect on life, enjoy music, or listen to audiobooks and podcasts. The high-intensity runs are rewarding in their own rite, challenging me to push my limits and explore my potential.

As of October 2024, six years since embracing running as a serious hobby, I've logged over 7,300 miles and completed five marathons. I'm excited to see where the next 6 years take me.

## Other Interests
I also enjoy reading as well as listening to audiobooks and podcasts. I mostly engage with nonfiction works on science topics, but I also enjoy fictional works, usually at the recommendation of a friend. My other interest include pixel art, cross stitch and Legos (particularly the architectures sets).
