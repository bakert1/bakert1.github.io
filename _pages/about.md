Hi! I’m Timothy Baker, a research fellow at Michigan Medicine of the University of Michigan. My adviser is Professor Nicholas Burris and our research focuses on applying advanced computer vision algorithms to the treatment and diagnosis of patients with various cardiovascular diseases.

## Education

I completed a Bachelor of Science degree in physics and in computer science at Rowan University (Glassboro, NJ). I graduated in 2017 and was awarded Rowan’s “Excellence in Physics Medallion” for my contribution to the Physics and Astronomy department.

Following Rowan, I attended the University of Michigan where I completed a Ph.D. in computer science and engineering in 2023. My Ph.D. adviser was Professor John P. Hayes. For more details on my professional history, check out my [resume](https://connectome.space/coming-soon/).

## Circling Two Passions

Looking back, my education and career has inadvertently circled around two topics: physics and computer science. Maybe that's not a surprise since I work in STEM where physics serves as the foundation and computing permeates nearly every field.

I applied to college as a computer science major. I thought that I could work on video games one day and, as a bonus, knowing how computers work would allow me to troubleshoot problems. I could be the family's go-to computer guy, like how some families have the 'car guy' who helps with auto issues. At the end of the year, however, my AP physics teacher, Mr. Wright, and the YouTube channel "minutephysics" inspired me to switch my major to physics.

I attended Rowan University as a physics major from 2013 to 2017. I also took computer science courses and liked them so much that I wound up double majoring. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Physics and Computer Science. Physics was my main passion, though, and I was awarded Rowan’s “Excellence in Physics Medallion” for my contribution to the Physics and Astronomy department.
