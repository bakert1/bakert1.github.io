Hi! I'm Timothy Baker, a postdoctoral research fellow at Michigan Medicine developing computer vision solutions to challenges in healthcare.

I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science in Engineering and my technical skills include Python programming, data science, deep learning, and high performance computing. Many of my [projects](/projects) have been in computer vision and digital design with a focus on health care applications.

I am currently on the job market, seeking a position where I can continue to develop data-drive solutions to challenges in areas of national importance. I am especially interested in the healthcare, semiconductor, and information technology industries.
