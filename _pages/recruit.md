Hi! I'm Timothy Baker, a postdoctoral research fellow at Michigan Medicine developing computer vision solutions to challenges in healthcare.

I am currently seeking a position where I can continue to develop data-drive solutions to challenges in the healthcare, semiconductor, or information technology industries.

Alongside developing technical know-how and expertise, I strive to understand the context of the problem as much as possible with the goal of developing solutions that have actual impact.

Please reach me at tim\[at\]bakertim.com to discuss what I may bring to your open data scientist (or similar) role.

Skills overview:
- Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering; B.Sc. Physics.
- Python (9 years); Libraries: PyTorch, Lightning, MONAI, Numpy, Pandas, etc.
- Data science expertise with focus on computer vision and deep learning.
- Experience developing high throughput neural networks on high performance computing (HPC) SLURM clusters.
- Experience developing efficient neural network for on-device machine learning.
- Led many successful research [projects](/projects) for applications health care and digital design (7+ first-author publications in leading IEEE/ACM venues).
