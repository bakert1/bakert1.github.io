## Circling Two Passions

Looking back, my education and career has inadvertently circled around two topics: physics and computer science. Maybe that's not a surprise since I work in STEM where physics serves as the foundation and computing permeates nearly every field.

I applied to college as a computer science major. I wanted to develop video games and learning about computers seemed like a good life skill. I imagined being the family's go-to computer guy, like how some families have the 'car guy' who helps with auto issues. At the end of the year, however, my AP physics teacher, Mr. Wright, and the YouTube channel "minutephysics" inspired me to switch my major to physics.

I attended Rowan University as a physics major from 2013 to 2017. In my second year, I started taking computer science courses that I liked so much that I wound up double majoring. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Physics and Computer Science. Physics was my main passion, though, and I was awarded Rowan’s “Excellence in Physics Medallion” for my contribution to the Physics and Astronomy department.

After Rowan, I applied to Ph.D. programs to study quantum computing - a mix of my two passions. I was admitted to University of Michigan's Computer Science and Engineering program. Although it was my third choice of program, I was disappointed that I wouldn't be pursuing a physics Ph.D. In hindsight though, attending this program was definitely for the best - I probably would not have been able to take so many artificial intelligence (AI) courses had I enrolled in a physics program.

During graduate school, I started t

During my Ph.D., I developed a passion for artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and biomedical engineering. My Ph.D. research touched on these fields, but I wanted to pursue them more directly. I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at Michigan Medicine studying applications of artificial intelligence in radiology.
